Music player that plays media stored in S3.

First release should allow me to do the following:

1. Authenticate
2. Upload mp3 (with indexing Genre/Band/Album/Song)
3. Browse music: Genre/Band/Album
4. Play: Genre/Band/Album/Song

The main goal of the project is to keep me uptodate with rails, backbone, html5, etc.
